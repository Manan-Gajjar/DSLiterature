    "\n",
    "It is an ensemble learning method that builds a strong classifier by combining the outputs of several weak classifiers (e.g., Decision Trees).The key idea is to sequentially improve weak learners by focusing on misclassified data points. Here’s a detailed explanation of some popular boosting algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)**\n",
    "    - **Core idea**: AdaBoost combines multiple weak learners (usually shallow decision trees called stumps) to create a strong learner by iteratively adjusting weights of misclassified samples.\n",
    "    - **How it works**:\n",
    "      1. Start with equal weights for all data points.\n",
    "      2. Train a weak learner (e.g., Decision Tree stump) on the data.\n",
    "      3. Calculate the error of the weak learner.\n",
    "      4. Assign higher weights to misclassified samples so that the next weak learner focuses more on them.\n",
    "      5. Repeat for a predefined number of iterations.\n",
    "      6. Combine all weak learners’ predictions using a weighted majority vote (weights are proportional to their performance).\n",
    "    - **Advantages**:\n",
    "      - Handles both classification and regression.\n",
    "      - Robust to overfitting when the number of iterations is small.\n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "      - Sensitive to noisy data and outliers (as weights can increase drastically for misclassified samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Boosting**\n",
    "    - **Core idea**: Gradient Boosting minimizes the loss function (e.g., MSE, log-loss) by sequentially adding weak learners that correct the errors of previous models. It uses gradient descent to optimize the loss.\n",
    "    - **How it works**:\n",
    "      1. Initialize the model with a constant prediction (e.g., mean for regression, log-odds for classification).\n",
    "      2. Compute the residuals (errors) for the current model.\n",
    "      3. Train a weak learner to predict these residuals (e.g., small decision trees).\n",
    "      4. Update the model by adding the predictions of the weak learner, scaled by a learning rate.\n",
